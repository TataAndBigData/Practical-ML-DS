Therefore, Python provides language features for iteration purposes. The first example is the ___while___ statement. This can be used for iteration by giving it a conditional statement, and keep repeating whatever is within the _while_ statement while the condition is met. Given the repetivive nature, this flow is known as a __loop__.\n",

It works in a similar manner to a _while_ statement, but instead of iterating while a given condition is still true, it iterates over a sequence of elements. One of the most common implementations of the _for_ statement is together with the __range()__ function, which generates an arithmetic sequence. It has three parameters: __(start, stop, step)__. __start__ is the number at which the sequence starts, __stop__ is the value at which the sequence ends, and __step__ is the common difference of the sequence.
