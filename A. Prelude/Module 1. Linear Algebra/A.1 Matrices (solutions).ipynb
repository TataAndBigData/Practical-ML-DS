    "# Matrix Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have covered vectors, we can expand this idea onto the concept of a __matrix__. Matrices are rectangular ordered arrays of numbers, symbols or expressions arranged in rows and columns. Its components are also referred to as __entries__. They are considered ordered as every entry position holds a different meaning. It is often useful to treat a matrix as a sequence of __column vectors__ or __row vectors__ given certain operations. In fact, given our definition, individual vectors can also be treated as matrices! For example, consider the three matrices below:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ A = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2  \\end{bmatrix} \\text{, }B = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3\\\\ 3 & 2 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\text{, } C =\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\\ 2 & 3 \\\\ 3 & 4 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We denote the dimensions of a matrix by first their number of rows, then their number of columns. In this case, A is a 2x1 matrix, B is a 2x3 matrix and C is a 3x2 matrix. The matrix A is also a column vector, and the matrix B can also be conceptualized as three 2-D column vectors or even two 3-D row vectors! If we let M,N be two integers, where M,N  > 1, and $a_{ij},i=1,...,M, j=1,...,N$ are $MN$ numbers, we can have the general representation of a matrix as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ A = \\begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & ... & a_{1j} & ... & a_{1N} \\\\\n",
    "                        \\vdots &    & \\vdots &     & \\vdots \\\\\n",
    "                        a_{i1} & ... & a_{ij} & ... & a_{iN} \\\\\n",
    "                        \\vdots &    & \\vdots &     & \\vdots \\\\\n",
    "                        a_{M1} & ... & a_{Mj} & ... & a_{MN} \n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Matrices are a meaningful way of representing data. Generally, moving along rows holds a specific meaning, which is different from moving along columns. For example, let us say that we are gathering data on a population, and we collect height, weight and gender from each person in a sample of 8 people. A simple matrix representation of this data is such that moving along rows we move to a different feature, and moving along columns we move to a different person's data, as shown in the diagram below. We see that in this case, once again, how we can treat the matrix as a list of vectors, where each vector contains the weight, height and gender of one person.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/matrix.png\"\n",
    "     alt=\"matrix\"\n",
    "     width=\"500px\"\n",
    "     height=\"400px\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Another reason that makes matrices are useful is that they enable the automation of large operations. Rather than carrying out individual operations for different vectors or even elements, we can carry out an operation on an entire matrix. This is especially useful when we have to process large volumes of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To represent matrices in standard Python, we can use __nested lists__, which are lists of lists. With NumPy, we can create multi-dimensional NumPy arrays. Using the _np.array(  )_ function, we can create a NumPy array with a nested list as an argument. Unlike with nested lists in standard Python, indexing of multi-dimensional NumPy arrays is different, as shown in the example below. This difference will be further elaborated upon in Chapter 3:"

    "Another useful interpretation of matrices, is to treat them as __linear transformations__. This means that we can consider matrices to be something that when multiplied with one or multiple input vectors, we get one or multiple output vectors in the same vector space. For example, consider the matrix product below. We can see that by multiplying a vector with a matrix we get another vector, both which are displayed in the diagram below:\n",

However, not all square matrices have an inverse. Matrices that have no inverse are known as __singular matrices__, and have a determinant equal to 0. Thus, to determine whether a square matrix has an inverse, we simply compute its determinant! Some examples of this concept are shown below:\n",

    "This is yet another example of why it is useful to visualize matrices as composed of column/row vectors. In this case, a matrix is orthogonal if its columns and rows are orthogonal unit vectors (orthonormal). This means that the inner product of its rows with its columns will yield 1 if it's the same vector, and zero otherwise. Thus, to check if a matrix is orthogonal, we simply have to prove that the inner product of different columns is 0 and their lengths are equal to 1. An example of an orthogonal matrix is shown below.\n",

    "# Eigenvalues & Eigenvectors\n",
    "We will now put together all we have covered together to understand one of the most important concepts in linear algebra: __eigenvalues__ and __eigenvectors__. Given a square matrix, A, its eigenvector(s), denoted by $\\vec{\\mathbf{v_{i}}}$ is/are vector(s) such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$A\\vec{\\mathbf{v_{i}}} = \\lambda_{i}\\vec{\\mathbf{v_{i}}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\lambda_{i}$ is the corresponding eigenvalue, a scalar.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Eigenvectors are any possible non-zero solutions for__ $\\mathbf{\\vec{v_{i}}}$ __the equation above__. What does this actually mean? Well, this is one of the instances where it makes sense to visualize a matrix as a linear transformation. As we saw earlier in our animation, we can apply a linear transformation to any vector with the appropriate number of components, and for a few vectors, the linear transformation only scales them by a given scalar value (their eigenvalue). These are the eigenvectors of that matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do we calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix? Some of you have probably already guessed that a vector with all zero components is always an eigenvector. This is known as a __trivial solution__, and since it applies to all matrices regardless of the corresponding eigenvalue, it doesn't tell us about any interesting properties of individual matrices. We are, therefore, interested in the __non-trivial solution(s)__ for the eigenvectors of a matrix. We can rewrite the general expression in the form below, which allows us to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$A\\vec{\\mathbf{v_{i}}} = \\lambda_{i}I\\vec{\\mathbf{v_{i}}}$$\n",
    "$$(A - \\lambda_{i}I)\\vec{\\mathbf{v_{i}}} = 0 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of you may be thinking: \"We can multiply both sides of the equation by $(A - \\lambda_{i}I)^{-1}$, but this results in the trivial solution we had intuitively found before. So what do we do now?\". Well, for $\\vec{\\mathbf{v_{i}}}$ to be a non-zero vector, $(A - \\lambda_{i}I)$ must be singular, meaning it CANNOT have an inverse. This is why there are so few \"exceptions\" that lead to the few eigenvectors of the matrix out of the infinitely many other vectors in the same vector space. Going one step further, we can use the determinant condition we came across before to solve for the eigenvalues of the matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$det(A - \\lambda_{i}I) = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we keep $\\lambda_{i}$ as a variable, the expression above gives us a polynomial equation, known as the __characteristic polynomial__ of the matrix, and solving it will give you the eigenvalues of the matrix! To find their corresponding eigenvectors, we plug each eigenvalue into the original expression and solve for the vector. A simple, 2x2 example is shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$A = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\\ 2 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\implies \n",
    "A - \\lambda_{i}I = \\begin{bmatrix} 1-\\lambda_{i} & 2 \\\\ 2 & 1-\\lambda_{i} \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$det(A - \\lambda_{i}I) = 1 - 2 \\lambda_{i} + \\lambda_{i}^{2} - 4 = \\lambda_{i}^{2} - 2 \\lambda_{i} - 3 = 0$$\n",
    "$$ \\lambda_{1} = -1, \\lambda_{2} = 3$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can find the respective eigenvectors of each eigenvalue. We will start with the eigenvector of $\\lambda_{1}$:\n",
    "$$\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\\ 2 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix}v_{x} \\\\ v_{y}\\end{bmatrix} = \n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}-v_{x} \\\\ -v_{y}\\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ v_{x} + 2v_{y} = -v_{x}$$\n",
    "$$ 2v_{x} + v_{y} = -v_{y}$$\n",
    "This means that the corresponding eigenvectors of $\\lambda_{1}$ is any vector such that $v_{x} = -v_{y}$. We can generalize these to obtain our eigenvectors (which are all scalar multiples of each other):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{\\vec{v_{1}}} = t\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{bmatrix}, \\text{where } t \\in \\Re$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The same procedure can be applied for the second eigenvalue, resulting in the following eigenvector:\n",
    "$$\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\\ 2 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix}v_{x} \\\\ v_{y}\\end{bmatrix} = \n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}3v_{x} \\\\ 3v_{y}\\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ v_{x} + 2v_{y} = 3v_{x}$$\n",
    "$$ 2v_{x} + v_{y} = 3v_{y}$$\n",
    "$$v_{x}=v{y}$$\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{\\vec{v_{1}}} = \\alpha\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}, \\text{where } \\alpha \\in \\Re$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And that's it! This procedure can be applied to a square matrix of any size. However, as you can see from the 2x2 case, even a simple example can be time-consuming. For larger matrices, it is highly impractical to manually compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix, so, as usual, we write programs to do the hard stuff for us. Below we show how to use NumPy to calculate the eigenvalues/eigenvectors of any square matrix. We will use _np.linalg.eig(  ),_ which returns the only possible eigenvector of unit length. In reality, any scalar multiple of this vector is also a valid solution!"
