    "## Intro - XGBoost summary\n",
    "XGBoost is a shorthand for eXtreme Gradient Boost. It is much like gradient boosting with decision trees. Similarly, it starts by making a single constant estimate for all examples and then uses a decision tree which predicts not the label, but the size and magnitude of the update that needs to be made to the previous estimate. The difference lies in the type of tree that it uses to make predictions, how they are grown and cut down, and a bunch of optimisations that are made to allow it to work well for large datasets. Below, we firstly discuss the XGBoost trees, then making them into an ensemble, then the optimisations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a summary of the XGBoost algorithm\n",
    "- make an initial prediction\n",
    "- build an XGBoost tree the predicts the residual of the initial prediction\n",
    "- prune the XGBoost tree\n",
    "- build another tree that \n",
    "- stop when \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## XGBoost trees\n",
    "\n",
    "Each XGBoost tree starts with a single leaf which contains all of the residuals between the final predictions and their labels. We then calculate a **similarity score** for this leaf. This similarity score is like the mean squared error except that the quantity is squared once the individual errors have been added rather than before.\n",
    "This means that negative and positive errors can cancel out to reduce the overall similarity.\n",
    "The prediction made by the leaf is always the mean of the examples; so there will be feature values above and below the prediction (if more than a single example).\n",
    "The equation also includes a regularisation parameter $\\lambda$ added to the denominator. \n",
    "You can see this from the equation used to compute it below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Similarity $= \\frac{(\\Sigma^k x - y)^2}{k+\\lambda}$\n",
    "Where k is the number of examples which this tree makes predictions for.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: we do not square the residuals before adding them up.** This means that residuals that are on opposite sides of the prediction cancel each other out, reducing the similarity score. \n",
    "\n",
    "The question is: would splitting the data classified by this tree produce a total similarity that is less than the current similarity.\n",
    "To do this, we consider every possible split of this subset of datapoints (every midpoint between successive datapoints ordered along each axis). So we test each of these points by splitting the data at that feature's value to produce two leaves, then we again evaluate the similarity score for each of those leaves and add them together. The difference between the original similarity score and the sum of similarity scores over each leaf of one of these XGBoost trees is called the **gain**.\n",
    "\n",
    "$Gain \\ = \\ similarity_{left} + similarity_{right} - similarity_{root}$\n",
    "\n",
    "This gain is a heuristic indicating the best way to extend the tree.\n",
    "Unlike other trees, it is not weighted by the number of examples that end up in each region.\n",
    "It is also dependent on the similarity score of the parent leaf. \n",
    "Relative rather than absolute?\n",
    "\n",
    "We evaluate the gain resulting from each of the potential splits. \n",
    "Then we extend the tree by adding the best split to the \n",
    "\n",
    "Every leaf for a regular tree had a loss.\n",
    "Instead of a loss, every leaf on an XGBoost tree has a similarity score.\n",
    "Only branches have gains, not leaves, this is because the gain is calculated from the similarity of the leaves which it has.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How is this type of tree different to regular boosting trees?\n",
    "Instead of continuing to grow the tree by whichever split produces the least mean squared error (for regression), these XGBoost trees grow the tree by making branches (splits) that produce leaves with the greatest gain in similarity score.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why is it better?\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is the meaning of the similarity score?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pruning trees\n",
    "Once we have built a tree, we prune it based on it's similarity scores.\n",
    "To do this, we choose a number $\\gamma$. \n",
    "We then start at the branches closest to the leaves of the tree and evaluate whether the similarity score for each of them is greater than $\\gamma$ by computing\n",
    "\n",
    "$ similarity - \\gamma$\n",
    "\n",
    "If this quantity is less than zero, that is that the similarity is less than \\gamma, then we remove that branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\gamma$ is known as the tree complexity parameter.\n",
    "This is because the larger it is, the greater the gain needed for a split to prevent it's fork being pruned, and more pruning reduces the capacity (complexity of representable functions) of the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note that even if we set \\gamma to zero, we do not turn off pruning because the gain may be negative, in which case the above equation will still be less than zero and cause the branch to be pruned.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a leaf gets pruned, the predictions for examples that originally ended up at that leaf will now be made by the parent.\n",
    "So the parent will become a predictor that makes predictions based on more examples.\n",
    "The denominator in the similarity score computation then becomes less sensitive to lambda.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The regularisation parameter $\\lambda$\n",
    "Recall that our equation for computing the similarity included a term in the denominator which was $+\\lambda$.\n",
    "$\\lambda$'s effect on the similarity is to reduce the metrics' sensitivity to individual observations. \n",
    "It does this by increasing the susceptibility of branches to be pruned as it is increased.\n",
    "When this happens, the examples that would have then been classified by each leaf stemming from that branch are now classified by a leaf which replaces it.\n",
    "That is, a single prediction has to be made for a bunch of datapoints that were previously split into different leaves.\n",
    "This prediction will have worse training error, but should help the model to generalise by reducing the sensitivity to more specific splits of data.\n",
    "This is how $lambda$ regluarises the model and counteracts overfitting. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Making predictions with individual XGBoost trees\n",
    "Once we've made these trees we need to make predictions for examples that end up on each leaf.\n",
    "The predicted value for an example that arrives at a given leaf of an XGBoost regression tree is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "## $output = \\frac{sum\\ of \\ residuals}{number\\ of\\ residuals + \\lambda}$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is much like the calculation for the similarity score, except for the fact that we don't square the sum of the residuals. It is like taking the average of the labels of the examples from the training set that arrived at this leaf, except from the regularisation term which reduces the contribution that this tree has to the output as it increases. As the number of training examples at a leaf increases far beyond the value of lambda (or lambda = 0), the prediction tends to the average of the label.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This prediction is added to the sequence of previous predictions when the trees are combined with the initial average prediction.\n",
    "So increasing $\\lambda$ reduces the influence of each tree on the output prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Let's implement an XGBoost regression tree from scratch."

    "# XGBoost for classification\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cover\n",
    "The minimum number of residuals in each leaf of an XGBoost classification tree is determined by calculating the **cover** as such\n",
    " \n",
    "$cover = \\Sigma [previous\\ probability_i \\cdot (1 - previous\\ probability_i)]$\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous probability is the estimate that would be made if the parent node of this leaf were a leaf. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is the denominator of the similarity score minus $\\lambda$.\n",
    "It has a minimum of 1.\n",
    "So if the computed value for cover is less than this minimum, XGBoost would not allow the leaf to be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pruning \n",
    "For classification we prune in the same way as for XGBoost regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prediction with XGBoost classification trees\n",
    "\n",
    "The prediction for an XGBoost classification tree is given as the **log of the odds** of the example being a member of the positive class.\n",
    "\n",
    "## $prediction = log(odds) = log(\\frac{p}{1-p}) = \\frac{\\Sigma residual_i}{\\Sigma (previous\\ probability_i \\cdot (1 - previous\\ probability_i)  + \\lambda}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Other than lambda, this is the same formula used for regular gradient boosting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: $previous\\ probability$ in the denominator is not the log odds predicted by any leaf of a tree, it is the actual probability. We would need to convert the log odds to a probability by applying the softmax function to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prediction with the whole XGBoost algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that XGBoost is an ensemble method because it combines predictions made by multiple models.\n",
    "For regression this is easy, because each model is just predicting the residual.\n",
    "For classification it's a little different:\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, the initial prediction was made by taking an average of the binary class labels, which means that it represents a probability. The predictions from each tree however represent something different, that is the $log(odds)$. Hence it doesn't make sense to add these different quantitites together. Before we do that we need to transform the initial prediction to represent a $log(odds)$. We do that by applying the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "## $log(odds) = log(\\frac{p}{1-p})$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: This is the inverse of the logistic function.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, the final output prediction does not represent the usual confidence that the example is a member of the positive class because it is a sum of the $log(odds)$ rather than that probability. So we need to transform it back from a $log(odds)$ to represent the probability which is what we care about.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why log odds?\n",
    "We combine predicted log odds rather than probabilities because \n",
    "1) probabilities from many trees may sum up to more than 1 which doesn't make sense for a probability and \n",
    "2) because the residual may be negative, which is the target we need to predict, and the equation for computing the output of a leaf is always positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Computing the final output\n",
    "So to compute the ensembled prediction, we sequentially add the prediction (the log odds) from each tree (which can be any positive or negative number), weighted by the learning rate $\\eta$, to the initial prediction after transforming it into a log odds from a probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## $h_{log(odds)} = log(\\frac{h_0(x)}{1-h_0(x)}) + \\Sigma^l_{i=1} \\eta h_i(x) $\n",
    "\n",
    "We can convert this final prediction back into a probability by applying the logistic function to it:\n",
    "\n",
    "## $h_{probability} = \\sigma(h_{log(odds)}) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-h_{log(odds)}}}$"

    "### The approximate greedy algorithm\n",
    "Because the tree splits are made based on the immediate gain, without considering how the examples that end up on that leaf might be separated by further splits, the algorithm is **greedy**.\n",
    "If the algorithm did not choose to make splits greedily, it would have to consider all possible ways to grow the tree.\n",
    "Exponentially many more trees become possible as the number of branches increase, so because it acts greedily, XGBoost does not waste time rolling out all possible future splits and evaluating them from a given new leaf.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the number of examples increases, so does the number of possible splits (midpoints between any particular feature examples), and hence the compute time and memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of features of each example also linearly increases the number of splits that need to be considered, and hence the compute time and memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "To counteract this, XGBoost does not consider every possible feature midpoint between sequential examples over all different feature dimensions. \n",
    "Instead it groups the examples into quantiles and considers splitting the data at only those positions.\n",
    "The number of quantiles is a hyperparameter.\n",
    "For example, if we chose to split a dataset of 30 examples into 3 quantiles, then for each feature, we would test splitting the data at the value of the 10th and 20th example's feature value.\n",
    "This would reduce the number of splits to test from 29 down to 2.\n",
    "This is called the *approximate* greedy algorithm.\n",
