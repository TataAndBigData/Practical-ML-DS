    "# Chain Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, however, the functions we encounter are not as clean as the ones shown above. Often, they are what are known as __composite functions__, functions composed of sub-functions, such as the example below:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(x) = sin(x)^{2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a rule for calculating the derivative of $x^{2}$ and the derivative of $sin(x)$, but how do we go about this example? This is where the __chain rule__ comes in. When we don't know how a variable changes with respect to another, we can use the chain rule to determine this quantity by seeing how both quantities vary with some intermediary quantity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us rewrite the equation, by allowing $u = sin(x)$, our intermediary quantity, getting the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(u) = y = u^{2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us consider an average slope calculation for now. We want to compute the average slope of $y$ with respect to $x$ $(\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x})$. We can re-write it in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x} \\times 1 =\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x} \\times \\frac{\\Delta u}{\\Delta u} = \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta u} \\times \\frac{\\Delta u}{\\Delta x}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Which, when we make the changes $\\Delta y, \\Delta x \\text{ and } \\Delta u$ very, very small, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{dy}{du} \\times \\frac{du}{dx}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So in the case of our example, we get the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$(1) \\; \\frac{dy}{du} = \\frac{d(u^{2})}{du} = 2u = 2sin(x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$(2) \\; \\frac{du}{dx} = \\frac{d(sin(x))}{dx} = cos(x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$(3) \\; \\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{dy}{du} \\times \\frac{du}{dx} = 2sin(x)cos(x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "What does this mean? We are using the variable $\\mathbf{u}$ as an __intermediary function__ to determine the rate of change of $y$ with respect to $x$. If we know the rate of change of $y$ with respect to $u$ $(\\frac{dy}{du})$, and we know exactly how $u$ changes with respect to $x$ $(\\frac{du}{dx})$, we can use both rates of change to calculate the rate of change of $y$ with respect to $x$. In general, the chain rule for one intermediary variable is given as follows:\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\\text{or}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{dy}{du}\\frac{du}{dx}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is, however, not limited to only one intermediary variable, $u$, we can have multiple intermediary variables. However, we can simply apply the same rule as above multiple times. A common approach, informally known as __peeling the onion__, is the to differentiate the outer intermediary functions first, and progressively move inwards. Below we show an example with two intermediary variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y = cos(x^{2})^{4}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Which we can decompose as follows:\n",
    "$$ y = u^{4}, \\;\\; u = cos(v), \\;\\; v = x^{2} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "We find the respective derivatives:\n",
    "$$ \\frac{dy}{du} = 4u^{3}, \\;\\; \\frac{du}{dv} = sin(v), \\;\\; \\frac{dv}{dx} = 2x $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we can determine our desired derivative:\n",
    "$$\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{dy}{du}\\frac{du}{dv}\\frac{dv}{dx} \\\\ = 4u^{3}sin(v)2x  \\\\ = 4cos(v)^{3}sin(v)2x \\\\ = \n",
    "8cos(x^{2})^{3}sin(x^{2})x    $$\n",

    "### Chain-rule real-life analogy: COVID-19\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us consider the following scenario. You are a data scientist trying to use the data you collected during the crisis to try and model the growth of COVID-19. After using certain statistical methods, you were able to determine that, without self-isolation measures or protective face masks, you can model the growth of COVID-19 deaths in early stages with the following function:\n",

    "$$D(u) = e^{u} = e^{\\sqrt{t}}$$\n",

    "Where $D(u)$ is the number of COVID-19 deaths as a function of time, $t$ is time measured in days and $u(t)$ is an intermediary function.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that, according to our model, COVID-19 deaths grow exponentially with respect to the square root of time. But that is not sufficient analysis to base our policies on, so we decide we want to calculate __the rate of change of COVID-19 deaths as a function of time__, or in mathematical terms, $\\frac{dD(t)}{dt}$. So how do we go about this? Let us first plot in two separate plots our function $D$ in terms of our intermediary function, $u$, alongside the function $u$ with respect to time, $t$."
